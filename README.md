Muhammad is a Postdoctoral research fellow at LEEP, working under the supervision of Professor Daniel Williamson, Professor Brett Day, Professor Alex Diaz (UCL), and Dr Amy Binner for the project ADD-TREES: AI-elevated Decision-support via Digital Twins for Restoring and Enhancing Ecosystem Services. He was awarded a PhD in Mathematical Sciences (Statistics Group) from Durham University under the supervision of Dr Jonathan Cumming, and Professor Ian Vernon with the prestigious Durham Doctoral Scholarship. 

Before joining Exeter, Muhammad worked as a Lecturer and an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the Department of Statistics at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

His research interests include uncertainty quantification and decision-making for computer models of complex physical systems, often involving developing emulators via Deep Gaussian processes & Bayes linear methods. The real fun of his research is performing the model calibration (history matching) while introducing clever techniques of high dimensionality to learn about the historical data.
