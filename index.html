    Muhammad is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at LEEP, working under the supervision of Professor Daniel Williamson, Professor Brett Day, Professor Alex Diaz (UCL), and Dr. Amy Binner for the project <strong>ADD-TREES</strong>: AI-elevated Decision-support via Digital Twins for Restoring and Enhancing Ecosystem Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    He was awarded a PhD in Mathematical Sciences (Statistics Group) from Durham University under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Cumming and Professor Ian Vernon, with the prestigious Durham Doctoral Scholarship.

  <p>
    Before joining Exeter, Muhammad worked as a Lecturer and an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the Department of Statistics at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
  </p>
  <p>
    His research interests include uncertainty quantification and decision-making for computer models of complex physical systems, often involving the development of emulators via Deep Gaussian Processes and Bayes linear methods. His favorite part of the research is performing model calibration (history matching) while introducing clever techniques to handle high-dimensionality and extract insight from historical data.
